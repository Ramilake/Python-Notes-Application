This is an application that I based off of an YouTube guide for a Python note taking app
by "Code with Stein", it can be found here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trwXaGu-Lys

I created a super user:
username is 'ramilake'
email is 'rami_pele@yahoo.com'
password is '9932734Jamrah'


To run the application go into the folder:
/Users/ramilake/Desktop/github/Notepad_App_python/notes_app/notes

Then run,

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

That will give you the http address and from there the app is running.
Also, even the changes are saved between uses...


Application Complete
